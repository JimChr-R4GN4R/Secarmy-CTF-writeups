When read the description my first thought was to use a scraper...

So I started with Instagram. I have made a scraper in python for my University 

https://github.com/JimChr-R4GN4R/Python_University_Projects/tree/master/Askhsh_6 (We love Patsakis <3)

so I used it to scrape Instagram posts with the hashtag '#wearesecarmy' by typing:

<code>python3 scraper.py --comments --tag wearesecarmy</code>
