Aliens on the way ..
Flag Format : secarmy{flag}

I uploaded in the folder the flag.txt

I had no idea what this is :'(

After some hours I tried to search on duckduckgo this:

'&%$#"!=6;:98765.Rsrqponmlkjihgfedcba\`_^]

And the only link it gave me was this one:

https://st98.github.io/diary/posts/2019-07-14-innoctf.html

This is really nice...At the bottom of the page it had a solution about a similar challenge!

Found that this text is called 'Malbolge' and if I understood correctly is like a program language which can be readed by Malbolge compilers..

So tried to use this compiler: http://malbolge.doleczek.pl/

But gave <code>Invalid syntax!!</code> ....

After hours I found that this was the flag -_- ...

This challenge's lesson... Try all the outputs even if they say 'false','Invalid syntax' etc.

Flag: secarmy{Invalid syntax!!}
