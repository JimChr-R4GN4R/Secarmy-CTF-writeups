When saw that my first thought was MORSE,but tried it and failed.After some research,I searched on Duckduckgo "Tap cipher" and found a type of cryptography called "Tap code"
and it was using dots.

So found a tap code decoder https://www.braingle.com/brainteasers/codes/tapcode.php and decoded the message <code>secarmytpfrflag</code>.

Flag: secarmy{tpfrflag}
