I did not see this format before,so gone to https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cipher-identifier to get something. It did not find the format and I was going to close the tab.
But I checked the place where it shows the results and saw this:

Analysis Results

s e c a r m y { I _ l 0 v e &#...

Your ciphertext is likely of this type:

This is our flag's beginning!!!

So I put some of them to get the beginning and the rest of them to get the last part.

And the last part is this:

Analysis Results

_ U n i c 0 d e � }

Your ciphertext is likely of this type:

So the final flag should be this:

secarmy{I_l0ve_Unic0de�}

So tried it but is incorrect :(

So searched for &#x0 which is 0x0 in hex and is not a recognizable character,so I just removed it and apparently it worked!

flag: secarmy{I_l0ve_Unic0de}
