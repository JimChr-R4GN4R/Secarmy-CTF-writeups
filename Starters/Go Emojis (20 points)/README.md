Here's official server of SECARMY let's see if you can find the flag :) 
Server Link : https://discord.gg/AMvR2WW

When I got in, gone to a room and saw that it has a bot called NullCTF.
So if you type <code> >help </code>, it prints a manual how to use it.
It says that you can request things from it by writing <code> >request </code>.
So typed <code> >request flag</code>.
But no result... :(

So after some time of searching in the server,I typed on search flag and gone to the first results.
I found a message from  a bot called MEE6 which was saying that you will get the flag by typing <code>!flag</code>.
So I did and recieved a pm from the bot with a flag from secarmy!So I put it,but it was wrong... :(

So after some minutes,admin said that flag has nothing to do with the bots...
So I checked one more time challenge's title.Go Emojis... Thinked to check server's emojis... SO I checked them all and found an emoji that has this name:
<code>:secarmyg0_Ing_hs_the_flag:</code>

So tried edit it and it worked!!!

Flag secarmy{g0_Ing_hs_the_flag}
